# Steam Remote API Documentation

## Introduction
This is an overview of the RESTful API for the Steam Remote HTTP API, first documented by [SteamDB](http://steamdb.info/blog/31/) back in October 2013. They later released [another blogpost](http://steamdb.info/blog/37/) with more information and a link to a repository providing some more functionality than that which is in the _headsDown.html_ file provided with Steam as of December 19th.
